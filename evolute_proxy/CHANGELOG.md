# Changelog

## 1.0.43

- Lowered minimal `sensors_refresh_interval` in add-on schema from 30s to 5s.
- Bumped add-on version to `1.0.43`.

## 1.0.42

- Fixed `/sensors/all` preparation script fields exposure for payload variants where `preparation_script` exists only at the top level.
- Added merge from cached full sensor payload to ensure `preparation_scriptIsrunning`, `preparation_scriptAvailable`, `preparation_scriptDisabled`, `preparation_scriptEndTime`, `preparation_scriptStartTime` are present.
- Bumped add-on version to `1.0.42`.

## 1.0.41

- Added preparation script fields to `/sensors/all`: `preparation_scriptIsrunning`, `preparation_scriptAvailable`, `preparation_scriptDisabled`, `preparation_scriptEndTime`, `preparation_scriptStartTime`.
- Added Home Assistant raw attributes and entities for preparation script status/timestamps.
- Updated dashboard card to include new preparation script sensors.
- Bumped add-on version to `1.0.41`.

## 1.0.40

- Added periodic car metadata fetch from `car-service/car/v2/{CAR_ID}` and exposed VIN/model fields in `/sensors/all`.

- Bumped add-on version to `1.0.40`.

## 1.0.39

- Fixed `/sensors/all` to preserve scalar metadata from both top-level and `sensors` roots of Evolute response (including `isOnline`).
- Bumped add-on version to `1.0.39`.

## 1.0.38

- Fixed `/sensors/all` payload normalization so top-level metadata like `isOnline` is preserved with either JSON_SUB shape.
- Bumped add-on version to `1.0.38`.

## 1.0.36

## 1.0.35

- Added `time` attribute to `home-assistant/evolute_rest.yaml` for users who reference the raw top-level timestamp directly.

- Bumped add-on version to `1.0.35`.

## 1.0.34

- Updated `/sensors/all` to include all scalar top-level fields from Evolute payload in addition to `sensorsData`, preventing sensor attribute loss in Home Assistant.
- Kept backward-compatible `sensorDataTime` alias mapped from top-level `time`.
- Bumped add-on version to `1.0.34`.

## 1.0.33

- Fixed `/sensors/all` payload to include online state fields (`isOnline`, `lastOnlineTime`, `sensorDataTime`) for Home Assistant binary sensors.
- Bumped add-on version to `1.0.33`.

## 1.0.21
